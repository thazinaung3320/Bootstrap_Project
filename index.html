        Travelling helps us find a path to escape from our stressful daily routine even if for a while. We should give time for us to rest after having passed every single tiring day. However, it's more stressful to plan and arrange even a trip into the city as lots and lots to consider relating price, time and places. Therefore, we are here to help you find the best tour for you with resonable price which you don't need to think twice.

        <h4><b>Bagan</b></h4>
        <p>
          Bagan is one of the world's heritage and located in central Myanmar, known as golden land because of its plenty of golden pagodas. In Bagan, you can see historic pagodas here and there which are the landmarks of Bagan. Quiet surrounding, historic pagodas and the air of historic old city will give you the feeling of missing someone or something.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bagan’s monuments survived for centuries owing to their construction in well baked brick, combined with stone for structural soundness. One of their most striking architectural features is the regular use of true vault arching, a technique almost unknown elsewhere in Asia. These vaults could span large interior spaces. They needed to be lightweight, but still sturdy enough to support the massive superstructures above. The technology allowed the construction of distinctive temples entered through wide hallways, where the pilgrim comes face to face with a statue of Gotama, the Buddha, whose face is often gently lit from narrow skylights set high in the walls. The vaulting also permitted wide encircling inner corridors, which became canvases for Bagan’s artists to create statuary and frescoes celebrating Gotama’s previous lives, and important events from his last earthly existence prior to obtaining nirvana.
        </p>
        <p>
          Touring to Bagan will not only give you the relaxed feeling with peaceful surrounding, but also lots of archetectural wonders of the Bagan King Dynasty.

            <h4><b>Ankor Wat Temple</b></h4>
            <p>
              Angkor Wat is dedicated to the Hindu god Vishnu who is one of the three principal gods in the Hindu pantheon (Shiva and Brahma are the others). Among them he is known as the “Protector.” The major patron of Angkor Wat was King Suryavarman II, whose name translates as the “protector of the sun.” Many scholars believe that Angkor Wat was not only a temple dedicated to Vishnu but that it was also intended to serve as the king’s mausoleum in death.
            </p>
            <p>
              The construction of Angkor Wat likely began in the year 1116 C.E.—three years after King Suryavarman II came to the throne—with construction ending in 1150, shortly after the king’s death. Evidence for these dates comes in part from inscriptions, which are vague, but also from the architectural design and artistic style of the temple and its associated sculptures.
            </p>
            <p>
              According to ancient Sanskrit and Khmer texts, religious monuments and specifically temples must be organized in such a way that they are in harmony with the universe, meaning that the temple should be planned according to the rising sun and moon, in addition to symbolizing the recurrent time sequences of the days, months and years. The central axis of these temples should also be aligned with the planets, thus connecting the structure to the cosmos so that temples become spiritual, political, cosmological, astronomical and geo-physical centers. They are, in other words, intended to represent microcosms of the universe and are organized as mandalas—diagrams of the universe.

            <p>
              Bangkok welcomes more visitors than any other city in the world and it doesn’t take long to realise why. Bangkok is a city of contrasts with action at every turn. Marvel at the gleaming temples, catch a tuk tuk through bustling Chinatown or take a longtail boat through floating markets. Food is another Bangkok highlight, from local dishes served at humble street stalls to haute cuisine at romantic rooftop restaurants.
            </p>
            <p>
              Luxury malls compete with a sea of boutiques and markets, where you can treat yourself without overspending. Extravagant luxury hotels and surprisingly cheap serviced apartments welcome you with the same famed Thai hospitality. And no visit to Bangkok would be complete without a glimpse of its famous nightlife. Be it nightclubs, cabarets or exotic red-light districts, Bangkok never ceases to amaze.
            </p>
            <p>
              The best things to do in Bangkok tell the story of this fascinating city, which began as a small trading centre and port community on the west bank of the Chao Phraya River some 200 years ago. Today, while the city is up to speed with modern times, the grandeur and glory of its illustrious past still prevail. Be it dazzling temples, spectacular palaces, a world-famous floating market or colourful Chinatown, each of the famous Bangkok places has an intriguing story to tell.
            </p>
            <p>
              Chatuchak Weekend Market in Bangkok (locally known as JJ Market) was once only popular among wholesalers and traders, but it has now reached landmark status as a must-visit place for visitors to the Thai capital. The market’s sheer size and diverse collections of merchandise will bring any seasoned shoppers to their knees – it’s where you can literally ‘shop till you drop’.
            </p>
            <p>
              Chatuchak is home to more than 8,000 market stalls that are spread over more than 14 hectares. On a typical weekend, more than 200,000 visitors come here to sift through the goods on offer. Veteran shoppers would agree that just about everything is on sale here, although not all at the best bargain rates. But if you have one weekend in Bangkok, squeeze in a day trip to Chatuchak Weekend Market and you won’t be disappointed.
